            <div class="poem-text">
                <p>In the classroom’s quiet hum and gentle sway,</p>
                <p>There’s a beacon of light, a guiding ray.</p>
                <p>Ma’am Shy, with her kindness and grace,</p>
                <p>In every lesson, she finds her place.</p>
                <p>For Nash, Charl, Gerald, and me,</p>
                <p>She’s more than a teacher; she’s family.</p>
                <p>With patience and care, she nurtures our minds,</p>
                <p>Even when we’re stubborn or fall behind.</p>
                <p>Her voice is calm, her spirit bright,</p>
                <p>Guiding us through day and night.</p>
                <p>In every subject, she makes us see,</p>
                <p>The beauty in knowledge, the joy to be free.</p>
                <p>Though sometimes we’re quiet, sometimes we stray,</p>
                <p>She never gives up, she shows us the way.</p>
                <p>Through laughter and lessons, she’s always there,</p>
                <p>With a heart full of love and endless care.</p>
                <p>Ma’am Shy, you’re a gem so rare,</p>
                <p>With wisdom and patience beyond compare.</p>
                <p>We’re grateful for the support you give,</p>
                <p>And for teaching us more than just how to live.</p>
                <p>You’ve been a mother, a mentor, a guide,</p>
                <p>Standing with us, side by side.</p>
                <p>For all the lessons, the laughter, the tears,</p>
                <p>You’ve given us strength over the years.</p>
                <p>Happy Teacher’s Day, Ma’am Synab Andoy Melencio!</p>
                <p>From Nash, Charl, Gerald, and me too,</p>
                <p>We thank you for all that you do,</p>
                <p>For believing in us and seeing us through.</p>
                <p>In our hearts, you’ll forever remain,</p>
                <p>The teacher who eased our every pain.</p>
                <p>With love and respect, we celebrate you,</p>
                <p>For you’ve made our dreams and hopes come true.</p>

            <h2>Our Message for You</h2>
            <p class="message-text">
                Dear Ma’am Shy,<br><br>
                On this special day, we, the four best friends—Nash, Charl, Gerald, and I—want to thank you from the bottom of our hearts. 
                You’ve treated us like your own, guiding us with kindness, patience, and endless love. 
                Even when we were hardheaded or quiet, you never gave up on us. You taught us not just lessons from books, but lessons for life.<br><br>
                You’ve been more than just a teacher; you’ve been a mother, a mentor, and a friend. 
                We are so grateful for the support and care you’ve shown us. 
                Thank you for believing in us, for pushing us to do better, and for being there every step of the way.<br><br>
                Happy Teacher’s Day, Ma’am Synab Andoy Melencio! 
                We’re blessed to have you in our lives, and we’ll always carry the lessons you’ve taught us wherever we go.<br><br>
                With love and gratitude,<br>
                Keith, Nash, Charl, and Gerald
